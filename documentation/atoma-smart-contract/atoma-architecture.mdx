## Atoma Protocol Overview

Atoma is building the leading decentralized AI compute cloud, leveraging the Sui blockchain for cost-effective, efficient compute payments, and the Walrus layer for secure decentralized data availability and storage. Our aim is to deliver a decentralized, web3-native AI compute experience that rivals traditional web2 infrastructure in both performance and cost, with additional compute verifiability guarantees and both data and model privacy.

This document provides an overview of Atoma’s key components, user interaction flow, security mechanisms, and cost analysis.

### Atoma on the Sui Blockchain

Atoma’s core logic is managed through smart contracts on the Sui blockchain, which coordinates compute resources and handles payments. The main components are:

1. **AtomaDb**: Central object storing Atoma’s state, including:

   * `nodes`: Information about each node.

   * `models`: Available AI models.

   * `tasks`: Registered tasks.

   * `communal_treasury`: Balance of funds for nodes that complete compute actions.

2. **Task Struct**: Represents AI compute tasks with fields like:

   * `role`, `model_name`, `security_level`, and `price`.

3. **Stack Struct**: Allows users to pre-purchase compute units for a specific task. Fields include:

   * `max_price`, `total_compute_units`, and `task_id`.

A user acquires a `Stack` by paying the Atoma contract in advance, enabling flexible compute payments while keeping blockchain interactions minimal.

#### Atoma User Flow: Claiming Stack and Interacting with Nodes

```

    participant AtomaContract
    participant Node

    User->>AtomaContract: Request Stack for Task
    AtomaContract-->>User: Return Stack

    User->>Node: Request Compute (with Stack)
    Node->>Node: Verify Stack
    alt Stack Valid and Node Subscribed to Task
        Node-->>User: Accept Request and Provide Compute
        Node->>Node: Update Stack Credits
    else Stack Invalid or Node Not Subscribed
        Node-->>User: Reject Request
    end
```

The diagram illustrates the user’s interaction with Atoma’s contract and network nodes. This direct user-node engagement reduces gas fees and enhances efficiency by minimizing blockchain transactions for routine tasks.

#### Flexible Node Selection for Compute Requests

1. **Single Node**: A specific node, selected at random.

2. **Limited Nodes**: A finite set of nodes, chosen at random.

3. **Any Subscribed Node**: User-selected based on performance criteria.

A forwarding mechanism allows nodes to reassign requests, enhancing load management and network responsiveness.

### Security and Data Availability with Walrus

Atoma uses Walrus as a Data Availability Layer to address potential issues with node liveness and data integrity. Here’s how it works:

1. User stores a signed request on Walrus.

2. User sends the request’s `blob_id` to a node.

3. Node verifies the request, then performs compute if conditions are met.

#### Dispute Handling and Remote Attestation

If a node fails to deliver, users can initiate a dispute. Nodes are required to provide proof via `blob_id` on Walrus. Failure results in collateral slashing.

```
sequenceDiagram
participant User
participant Walrus
participant Node
participant AtomaContract

User->>Walrus: Store signed request hash in 'requests'
User->>Node: Send signature and blob_id
Node->>Walrus: Verify request in blob_id
Node->>Node: Check availability, price, and Stack credits
alt Request accepted
    Node->>Node: Generate response
    Node->>User: Send response directly
    Node->>Walrus: Store signed response in 'responses'
    Node->>User: Send proof of storage
    opt If TEE required
        Node->>AtomaContract: Submit Remote Attestation
    end
else Request rejected
    Node->>User: Send rejection
end
opt If node fails to store response
    User->>AtomaContract: Start dispute
    AtomaContract->>Node: Request blob_id
    alt Node provides blob_id
        Node->>AtomaContract: Submit blob_id
    else Node fails to provide blob_id
        AtomaContract->>Node: Slash deposited collateral
    end
end
```

### Sampling Consensus and Verifiability

Atoma combines **Sampling Consensus** and **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** for secure, private, and verifiable inference:

1. **Sampling Consensus**: A single node is selected to process requests, with others randomly verifying results.

2. **TEE Integration**: If required, nodes execute requests in TEEs, ensuring secure, tamper-free processing.
