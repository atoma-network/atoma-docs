# Atoma Technical Architecture Report

## Summary

Atoma represents a breakthrough in confidential computing infrastructure, delivering the industry's first scalable platform that combines automated Kubernetes deployments, distributed ledger-based attestation, and composable encryption for enterprise AI workloads. This technical report details the core architectural components that enable Atoma to provide hardware-level security guarantees while maintaining cloud-native scalability and developer experience.

## 1. Automated Confidential Kubernetes Platform

### 1.1 Master Pod Architecture

Atoma's Kubernetes deployment model centers around a sophisticated master pod architecture that orchestrates confidential computing resources:

**Master Pod Responsibilities:**
- **Attestation Orchestration**: Coordinates hardware attestation across all worker nodes
- **Key Management**: Manages encryption key lifecycle and distribution
- **Security Policy Enforcement**: Ensures compliance with defined security policies
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizes placement of confidential workloads based on hardware capabilities

### 1.2 Confidential Computing Integration

**Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Stack:**

    B --> C[Guest Kernel]
    C --> D[Hypervisor]
    D --> E[TEE Hardware Layer]
    E --> F[Intel TDX / AMD SEV-SNP]
    F --> G[CPU Hardware]
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Memory Isolation**: Hardware-enforced memory encryption with 256-bit AES keys
- **CPU State Protection**: Register and cache isolation preventing side-channel attacks
- **Interrupt Handling**: Secure interrupt virtualization within TEE boundaries
- **DMA Protection**: IOMMU-based protection against DMA attacks

### 1.3 Kata Containers Deep Integration

Atoma leverages Kata Containers with custom modifications for enhanced security:

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Micro-VM Boot Time**: <500ms startup time for confidential containers
- **Memory Overhead**: Lower overhead compared to standard containers
- **I/O Performance**: Near-native disk and network performance through paravirtualization

### 1.4 GPU Operator Integration

**NVIDIA Confidential Computing Integration:**

- **GPU Memory Encryption**: Hardware-based encryption of GPU memory contents
- **Secure Multi-Tenancy**: Cryptographic isolation between GPU workloads
- **Attestation Integration**: GPU hardware attestation integrated with broader platform attestation

### 1.5 Encrypted Messaging Infrastructure

**Network Security Properties:**
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Unique session keys for each communication session
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Quantum-resistant key exchange algorithms
- **Zero-Knowledge Networking**: Network infrastructure cannot decrypt pod communications
- **Automatic Key Rotation**: Session keys rotated on a periodic basis or upon certain threshold limit of data transfer

## 2. Atoma Registry: Distributed Ledger Infrastructure

### 2.1 Disributed Ledger-Based Attestation and Key Management

- Distributed ledger technologies allow storing remote attestation and master encryption keys in an immutable and transparent way.
- Creates a vehicle for auditing procedures, and build a full historical chain of trust.

### 2.2 Remote Attestation Verification Service

**Attestation Verification at Scale:**
- **Throughput**: Can process a large number of attestation verifications per second
- **Latency**: Low average verification time
- **Global Distribution**: Verification nodes across 15+ geographic regions
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime SLA with automatic failover

### 2.3 Key Registration and Discovery

**Encryption Key Lifecycle Management:**

- In order to safeguard sensitive workloads and avoid potential replay attacks from malicious actors, Atoma enforces key rotation management sessions,
allowing cluster to rotate keys in a coordinated way, without affecting their underlying services. This process ensures a smooth rotation mechanism,
increasing security guarantees without compromising availability and uptime.

## 3. Composable Encryption Architecture

### 3.1 Multi-Layered Data Protection

**Encryption Layer Architecture:**

    A[User Data] --> B[User Encryption Layer]
    B --> C[System Encryption Layer]
    C --> D[Transport Encryption Layer]
    D --> E[Hardware Encryption Layer]
    
    F[System Prompts] --> G[System Encryption Layer]
    G --> D
    
    H[Application Logic] --> I[Application Encryption Layer]
    I --> C
```

### 3.2 Key Isolation and Management

## 4. High-Efficiency Deployment Architecture

### 4.1 Automated Deployment Pipeline
