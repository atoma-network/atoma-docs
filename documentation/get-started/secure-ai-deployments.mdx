## Custom Confidential AI Infrastructure

Atoma's secure AI deployment platform transforms any data center into a confidential computing environment capable of running enterprise-scale AI workloads with hardware-level security guarantees. Our technology stack combines advanced containerization, trusted execution environments, and cryptographic networking to deliver unprecedented security without sacrificing performance or flexibility.

Whether you need to deploy proprietary LLMs, protect sensitive training data, or ensure regulatory compliance, Atoma's infrastructure provides the security foundation that enables enterprises to confidently deploy AI at scale while maintaining complete control over their intellectual property and customer data.

## Core Technology Stack

### Secured Kubernetes Orchestration

Atoma's Kubernetes platform is purpose-built for confidential AI workloads:

- **Hardware-Isolated Pods**: Every pod runs within hardware-secured enclaves using Intel TDX or AMD SEV-SNP
- **Encrypted Pod-to-Pod Communication**: All inter-pod communication is encrypted with keys accessible only within the trust boundary of each pod
- **Confidential Container Runtime**: Kata Containers provide VM-level isolation with container-like performance
- **Attestation-Based Scheduling**: Kubernetes scheduler verifies hardware attestation before placing workloads
- **Secure Boot Chain**: Complete boot integrity from hardware to application layer

### End-to-End Encrypted Networking

Our networking architecture ensures that data remains encrypted throughout its entire lifecycle:

  <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4 text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100">Trust Boundary Architecture</h4>
  
  **Pod-Level Encryption Keys**
  - Each pod generates unique encryption keys within its TEE boundary
  - Decryption only possible within the specific pod's trusted execution environment
  - Network traffic remains encrypted until it reaches the destination pod's TEE
  
  **Cryptographic Network Fabric**
  - Layer 4 encryption between all pod communications
  - Hardware-rooted key derivation and rotation
  - Zero-knowledge networking - even network administrators cannot decrypt traffic
</div>
