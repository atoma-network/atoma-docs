## Welcome to Atoma

Atoma is a decentralized AI network that connects AI model providers with users seeking AI compute resources. Our platform streamlines AI model deployment and monetization while ensuring reliable access for users.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized AI Compute**: A network of execution nodes required to process AI requests. These include inference, text embeddings, fine-tuning, etc.
In short, Atoma provides a permissionless and scalable AI infrastructure.

- **Free Market Economics**: Implements a dynamic marketplace where:
  - Node operators set competitive rates for their compute resources
  - Users can choose nodes based on cost, performance, and privacy features
  - Intelligent request routing ensures cost-effective and efficient performance
  - Guarantees of maximum GPU utilization across the network, for maximum compute efficiency
  - Atoma's smart contracts ensure secure and transparent handling of compute resources and payments. 

- **Privacy and Security**:
  - Uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to safeguard user data and models and ensure computation integrity
  - Sampling consensus algorithm for AI compute integrity, for nodes not equipped with TEEs
  - Data remains inaccessible across the network, ensuring privacy and security

- **OpenAI API Compatibility**: Access the decentralized network through OpenAI-compatible APIs for seamless integration with existing applications.

- **Community Governance**: Atoma's treasury is managed by the community, with transparent reward distribution.
