## Welcome to Atoma

Atoma is a decentralized AI network that connects AI model providers with users seeking AI compute resources. Our platform streamlines AI model deployment and monetization while ensuring reliable access for users.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized AI Compute**: A network of execution nodes processes AI requests, from inference to fine-tuning, enabling a permissionless and scalable infrastructure.

- **Free Market Economics**: Implements a dynamic marketplace where:
  - Node operators set competitive rates for their compute resources.
  - Users can choose nodes based on cost, performance, and privacy features.
  - Intelligent request routing ensures cost-effective and efficient performance.

- **Privacy and Security**:
  - Uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to safeguard user data and models.
  - Sampling consensus algorithm ensures computation integrity.
  - Data remains inaccessible to anyone except the user and the model provider.

- **OpenAI API Compatibility**: Access the decentralized network through OpenAI-compatible APIs for seamless integration with existing applications.
