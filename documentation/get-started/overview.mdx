## Welcome to Atoma

Atoma is a decentralized AI network that connects AI model providers with users seeking AI compute resources. Our platform enables seamless deployment and monetization of AI models while ensuring reliable and efficient access for users.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized AI Compute**: A network of execution nodes that process AI requests, from running inference to fine-tuning models, creating a permissionless and scalable infrastructure.

- **Free Market Economics**: Implements a dynamic marketplace where:
  - Node operators set competitive rates for their compute resources
  - Users can choose nodes based on cost, performance, and privacy features
  - Intelligent request routing optimizes for efficiency and cost-effectiveness

- **Privacy and Security**:
  - Leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to protect user data and models
  - Sampling consensus algorithm ensures computation integrity
  - Data remains inaccessible to anyone except you and the model provider

- **OpenAI API Compatibility**: Access the decentralized network through familiar OpenAI-compatible APIs, making integration seamless for existing AI applications.
