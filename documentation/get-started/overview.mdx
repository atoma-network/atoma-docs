## Welcome to Atoma

Atoma is a decentralized private and verifiable AI execution network. It provides the infrastructure for developers and enterprises to use open-source AI models and build AI applications with full privacy.

There are several key components to Atomaâ€™s infrastructure: 

- **Decentralized AI Compute**: 
  - Atoma has a global network of GPUs that register on the network to perform inference requests, referred to as execution nodes. 
  - Rather than processing requests through a single data centre, Atoma is a fully permissionless network that works with data centres around the world to intelligently distribute AI requests.

- **Dynamic Marketplace**: 
  - Node operators set rates for their compute resources. 
  - Users select nodes based on cost, performance, and privacy preferences.

- **Atoma Proxy**: 
  - Each request is distributed to the most relevant node based on the hardware spec and whether privacy is requested, for that particular request. 
  - This ensures cost efficiency and performance. 

- **Privacy and Security**:
  - Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) ensure computations are secure and data remains private.
  - The Sampling Consensus Protocol verifies computation integrity across the network.
  - Data and model weights are inaccessible to unauthorized parties, protecting user and model provider assets.

- **OpenAI API Compatibility**: 
  - The network supports OpenAI-compatible APIs, allowing developers to integrate decentralized AI capabilities without reworking existing systems.

- **Community Governance**: 
  - Atoma's treasury is managed by the community, with transparent reward distribution.
