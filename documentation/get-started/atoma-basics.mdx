## What is the Atoma Network ?

The Atoma Network is a protocol designed to deliver decentralized, scalable, and permissionless AI computing, making powerful AI resources more accessible to all.

At the core of Atoma consists of execution nodes, or simply nodes, which represent a machine or a cluster of machines capable of processing AI requests on the network. These nodes handle tasks such as running AI inference to generate outputs from text prompts, creating images or videos from descriptions, translating documents, fine-tuning pre-trained models, and more.

## Full data privacy

With Atoma, your data is kept private and secure. By leveraging our advanced Sampling consensus algorithm and the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), we ensure that every AI request processed through the network is safeguarded against interference. TEEs protect your data and models, making them inaccessible to anyone, including Atoma’s nodes—except for you and the model provider.

Our Sampling consensus algorithm is engineered for cost-efficiency without compromising security. Designed to compete with leading AI compute providers like OpenAI and Anthropic, it ensures affordable AI processing, often at lower costs, while maintaining strong privacy protections.

Atoma’s commitment to AI verifiability and privacy will catalyze a new generation of applications, combining the potential of LLMs with uncompromising security and user-controlled data ownership.

Furthermore, Atoma’s verifiability layer can empower smart contracts across any blockchain to access secure, verifiable AI computing, enabling a new coordination layer of intelligence without compromising on security.
