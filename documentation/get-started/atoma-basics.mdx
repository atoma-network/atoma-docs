## What is the Atoma Network ?

The Atoma Network is a protocol designed to deliver decentralized, scalable, and permissionless AI computing, making powerful AI resources more accessible to all.

At the core of Atoma are execution nodes, or simply nodes, which represent a machine or a cluster of machines capable of processing AI requests on the network. These nodes handle tasks such as running AI inference to generate outputs from text prompts, creating images or videos from descriptions, translating documents, fine-tuning pre-trained models, and more.

## Full Data Privacy

With Atoma, your data is kept private and secure. Using our advanced Sampling Consensus algorithm and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), we ensure that every AI request processed through the network is safeguarded against interference. TEEs protect your data and models, ensuring they are accessible only to you and the model provider—even Atoma’s nodes cannot access them.

Our Sampling Consensus algorithm is designed for cost-efficiency without compromising security. Competing with leading AI compute providers like OpenAI and Anthropic, it ensures affordable AI processing while maintaining strong privacy protections.

Atoma’s commitment to AI verifiability and privacy will drive a new wave of applications, combining the power of LLMs with robust security and user-controlled data ownership.

Furthermore, Atoma’s verifiability layer also empowers smart contracts on any blockchain to securely access verifiable AI computing, creating a new intelligence coordination layer without compromising security.

## Why Sui Blockchain?

Atoma leverages the Sui blockchain for its core operations due to several key advantages:

- **Efficient Payment Processing**: Sui enables efficient compute payments with minimal transaction fees (~$0.02 per transaction).

- **Smart Contract Infrastructure**: Sui smart contracts handle compute resource coordination and payments, maintaining:
  - Node information and status
  - Available AI models
  - Task registrations
  - Treasury management for node rewards

- **Flexible Payment Model**: Users can pre-purchase compute units through a Stack system, enabling efficient payments while minimizing blockchain interactions for routine tasks.
