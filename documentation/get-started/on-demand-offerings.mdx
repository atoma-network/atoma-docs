## Confidential Generative AI APIs

Atoma's on-demand offerings provide immediate access to state-of-the-art generative AI models through privacy-preserving APIs that guarantee confidentiality for both system prompts and user data. Our platform leverages **composable encryption** technology to enable unprecedented levels of privacy protection, allowing service providers and end-users to maintain control over their respective sensitive information.

### Core Capabilities

**Multi-Modal AI Processing**
- Text generation and completion (gpt-oss, Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi models)
- Image generation and editing (Flux, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney)
- Audio processing and speech synthesis
- Video analysis and generation
- Code generation and completion

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Private document embedding and indexing
- Confidential knowledge base querying
- Secure vector database operations
- Private semantic search capabilities

**High-Performance Inference**
- Sub-second response times for most queries
- Batch processing for large-scale operations
- Real-time streaming responses
- Auto-scaling based on demand

## Composable Encryption: Dual Privacy Protection

Atoma's breakthrough **composable encryption** technology enables simultaneous protection of both system-level prompts (service provider IP) and user prompts (customer data), addressing a critical gap in current AI privacy solutions.

### How It Works

<div className="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900 p-6 rounded-lg border">
  <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Dual-Layer Privacy Architecture</h4>
  
  **Layer 1: System Prompt Protection**
  - Service providers' proprietary prompts, instructions, and system configurations remain encrypted
  - AI service companies can protect their prompt engineering IP and competitive advantages
  - System-level context and fine-tuning parameters are never exposed

  **Layer 2: User Data Protection**  
  - End-user prompts, documents, and responses are encrypted with user-controlled keys
  - Customer data remains confidential from both Atoma and the service provider
  - The combination of advanced cryptographic primitives and trusted execution ensure only the user can decrypt their data

### Real-World Use Case: Cursor IDE

Consider how Cursor IDE could leverage Atoma's composable encryption:

**Cursor's Protected Assets:**
- Proprietary system prompts that make Cursor's AI unique
- Custom code analysis algorithms and instructions
- Specialized programming assistance methodologies
- Training data and model fine-tuning parameters

**Developer's Protected Assets:**
- Private repository code and intellectual property
- Confidential business logic and algorithms
- Sensitive customer data within codebases
- Personal coding patterns and preferences

**Result:** Cursor can offer AI-powered development assistance while protecting both their competitive AI technology and their customers' proprietary code.

## Enterprise-Grade API Features

### OpenAI-Compatible Interface

  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-oss-120b",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "Your protected system prompt"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "User query with private data"}
    ],
    "confidential": true,
    "user_encryption_key": "user_public_key"
