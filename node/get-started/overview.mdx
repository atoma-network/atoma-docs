# What is a Node?

A node is a machine that joins the Atoma Network to help process AI tasks. Think of nodes as workers in a distributed workforce - each one contributes its computing power to run AI models and gets paid for their work.

When you run a node, you're essentially renting out your computer's processing power to users who need to run AI models but don't have the hardware themselves.

## Types of Nodes

There are two main ways your node can process AI tasks:

### 1. Sampling Consensus Nodes
These are the most common type of nodes. They:
- Run AI models in a standard way
- Work together with other nodes to verify that results are correct
- Are perfect for running public AI models where privacy isn't a concern
- Participate in our unique "Sampling Consensus" system where multiple nodes check each other's work

### 2. Confidential Compute Nodes
These are specialized nodes for private, sensitive AI tasks. They:
- Use special hardware security features called "Trusted Execution Environments" (TEEs)
- Process data in a completely private, encrypted space
- Are ideal for sensitive data that needs extra privacy protection
- Cost more to run but provide enhanced security guarantees

## How to Join the Network

Getting your node up and running involves a few simple steps:

1. **Choose Your Role**: Decide if you want to run a standard Sampling Consensus node or a Confidential Compute node (to become a Confidential Compute node, you need to have a TEE-enabled machine)

2. **Subscribe to Tasks**: 
   - Browse available AI tasks on the network
   - Choose which tasks you want to process
   - Set your price (how much you want to be paid)
   - Specify how much computing power you can offer

3. **Set Your Parameters**:
   - Pick the specific task IDs you want to work on
   - Set your price per unit of computation
   - Define your computing power limits
   - Register your node with a unique identifier

## How Nodes Make Money

Once your node is running:
1. The network automatically assigns you tasks
2. Your node processes the AI workloads
3. You submit proof that you completed the work
4. You get paid in tokens for successful computations

the better reputation you build, more often is your node picked to process AI workloads and therefore higher chances to earn value.

## Important Considerations

### Performance
- Keep your node online and responsive
- Maintain good internet connectivity
- Ensure your hardware meets minimum requirements to serve the AI workloads your node is subscribed to

### Security
- Safely store your node's private keys
- Keep your system updated and secure
- Monitor your node's performance

### Economics
- Set competitive prices to attract tasks
- Build a good reputation for more work
- Consider operating costs when setting prices
- Factor in electricity and hardware costs
