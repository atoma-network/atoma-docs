<Warning>
    During the alpha phase, Atoma is deployed on the SUI testnet.
</Warning>

## Overview
In this guide, we will help you with the node deployment:

1. Install Prerequisites
2. Deploy Node
3. Register Node
4. Subscribe Node to Task


## Install Prerequisites

1. System Requirements
```bash
sudo apt-get install curl git-all cmake gcc libssl-dev pkg-config libclang-dev libpq-dev build-essential
```

2. [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

3. [SUI CLI](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install)
```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch testnet sui --features tracing
```

4. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Setup SUI

1. **Connect to SUI Network** (more info [here](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/connect#configure-sui-client)). 
    This will allow your node to be able to interact with the Sui blockchain and therefore the Atoma smart contract. Running this will also automatically create a wallet.
    ```bash
    sui client
    ```

    Once you finish the steps above, you should have the following files created locally (you should replace ~ with your home folder directory, if needed):

    - `~/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml` - the Sui client configuration file
    - `~/.sui/sui_config/sui.keystore` - The Sui keystore file (contains your private key(s))

2. **Get SUI and TOMA tokens**

    Get faucet SUI tokens:
    ```bash
    sui client faucet
    ```

    Mint faucet TOMA testnet tokens:
    ```bash
    sui client call --package "0xa1b2ce1a52abc52c5d21be9da0f752dbd587018bc666c5298f778f42de26df1d" --module "toma" --function "faucet" --args "0xfdddd6fb95509ea36f44f06d0d0a2f5868dac2bda1423d204bdc9f458115ff75" 100000000000
    ```

    You can then query your wallet balance, to see your newly minted faucet SUI and TOMA tokens:
    ```bash
    sui client balance
    ```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
  
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the \~/.mintlify folder. Afterwards, run `mintlify dev` again.
