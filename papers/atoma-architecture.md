# Atoma architecture

In this article, we present a detailed description of the Atoma Network protocol. Atoma is designed to provide a robust, resilient and highly scalable permissionless decentralized AI compute network. Through Atoma many different applications can be built, from simple UI chat interfaces, personalized AIs to publicly-owned knowledge bases for specific communities.

As a permissionless network, Atoma's nodes are not necessarily under the same regulatory framework and are not necessarily aligned. This means that, in order to guarantee that any request being processed on the Atoma Network is processed correctly, without being tampered, it is necessary to guarantee high levels of *verifiability* of execution.

Another very desirable feature of Atoma relates to *privacy*. In a world, where multiple AI agents can be spawned with minimal costs, it is important that these agents do not leak any sensitive information about users, enterprises and governments. In order to achieve this, Atoma is designed to be privacy-preserving. 

Finally, Atoma will unlock the potential for full user data ownership, allowing the creation of a new era of AI applications, which we believe will unlock the full potential of AI.

This is only possible through a very optimized architecture for Atoma. In this article, we will cover every component of the network, ranging how applications can interact through the network, to how requests are processed across a decentralized network of nodes, how verifiability and privacy are achieved. We further explain how Atoma is designed to a be a general AI layer, this includes both inference of textual and multi-model AI models, as well as fine-tuning, embeddings and ultimately training of new AI models.
