### Abstract

Atoma is a permissionless decentralized protocol specialized for heavy verifiable compute. Atoma derives its features from compute providers, referred to as execution nodes (or simply nodes). Nodes on the Atoma Network are responsible for processing different types of compute requests.

AI inference requests are often processed through nodes that run Large Language models (LLMs) different types of inputs (text, images, video, audio, etc) and produce some form of output (which can be either text, or other formats for multi-modality capabilities). More standard and traditional models for time series predictions, recommendation systems, etc, will also be supported on the Atoma Network.

Due to the recent advances in the field of generative AI, the demand for such compute is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. It is estimated that decentralized cloud/edge infrastructure is expected to grow substantially by 2027, meaning it is likely that there will be substantial intersections between demand for compute, AI, and decentralized infrastructure.

Even though AI models are becoming more powerful at a fast pace, they are also becoming larger requiring higher memory and compute resources, overall. For this reason, to run the best AI models, it is crucial to have enough powerful hardware to run them at scale. For this reason, Atoma has been throughly designed to provide the right financial incentives to compute providers (also referred to as nodes) to acquire and deploy the best hardware. Such incentives combined with a robust efficient inference optimizations will lead to the best possible hardware resource utilization driving demand and lowering costs. 

That said, in order for Atoma Network to become a full intelligence layer powering Web3 protocols, it is required that AI inference is
served with high verifiable guarantees. That means, high guarantees that the AI generated output has not been tampered in any form. For this reason, we have established a novel sampling consensus protocol to ensure that Atoma Network nodes are able to provide high levels of verifiability for each AI compute request. Such sampling consensus protocol, referred to as `Sampling Consensus`, is based on the assumption that nodes are rational actors in an economic environment. Such protocol is optimized to achieve very high security guarantees, while having lower cost compared to other methods (such as zkML, opML, etc).

For the above reasons, the Atoma Network is well positioned to lead the space and opens the doors for the next generation of decentralized applications.
