# Why decentralized AI will consume all available block space ?

## Abstract

In this paper, we will analyze a few trends in the growth of generative AI models and compute, following the Situational Awareness paper. Following the growth of the Bitcoin network, in terms of both compute and hardware, we will also explore the potential of a decentralized AI network, such as the Atoma Network, to accommodate the future AI growth.

In a second part of the paper, following the trends in AI previously described, we will justify why decentralized AI networks need to completely decouple the execution layer from a settlement layer. Therefore, nodes in a decentralized AI network should not be responsible for producing blocks, to maintain the state of a global ledger. Instead, we will conclude that decentralized AI networks should rely on existing blockchains as a settlement layer. We will also explore why decentralized AI networks do not require specialized block space, instead they should only care about opaque block space on a set of blockchains, contrary to most dApps in Web3.

Moreover, under the lens of current AI demand, we will justify why in the future, decentralized AI networks will consume all current available block space.

## Introduction

We are inspired by Leopold Aschenbrenner's [Situational Awareness](https://situational-awareness.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/situationalawareness.pdf) paper, which analyzes the trends in the growth of AI and compute in the coming years, based on historical data. In this paper, we will explore how, if Leopold's predictions materialize, decentralized AI networks will be able to accommodate for the future AI growth.
