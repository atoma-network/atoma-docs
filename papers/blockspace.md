# Why decentralized AI will consume all available block space ?

## Abstract

In this paper, we will analyze a few trends in the growth of generative AI models and compute. We will also explore the potential of a decentralized AI network, such as Atoma Network, to accommodate for the future AI growth.

We will justify why decentralized AI networks need to completely decouple the execution layer from a settlement layer. Moreover, under the lens of current AI demand, we will justify why in the future, decentralized AI networks will consume all current available block space.
